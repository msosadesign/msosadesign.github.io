In today's world, **air pollution is a significant issue that affects everyone**. With more and more people becoming conscious of the impact of pollution on the environment and their health, **it's essential to raise awareness and encourage individuals to take action**. In this context, **Spotify, one of the most popular music streaming apps, can play a crucial role in spreading the word and inspiring its users to make positive changes**. This proposal outlines some ideas for how Spotify can leverage its platform to promote walking, reduce car usage, and educate its audience about air pollution, specifically targeting Gen Z and Millennials in Europe, where Spotify has the most active user base.

- Topic: Air pollution.
- App: Spotify.
- Target: Gen Z and Millennials. Europe being the most active country for Spotify.
- Numbers: time spent using Spotify (25 hours/month), 1/3 of this time on curated playlists.

#### Ideas:
- Generate a user-specific playlist for walking.
- Add a modal screen to invite users to walk and listen to the playlist or any podcast on the topic.
- Add a dedicated section on the homepage.
- For non-premium users, when an ad comes up and there isn't an ad available, instead of showing the default Spotify premium ad, talk about air pollution and how the user can help.

### Research
**My first step was understanding how the Spotify Design System “Encore” works**. I looked at the app from my phone and analyzed every component to understand how I can send the message to the users. I searched online and read articles about Spotify’s Design System and how it was built.

I chose approaches that were already there to not clash with the existing design but rather take advantage of it. This is how I chose a:
- Modal
- Dedicated section
- Advertisement
- Generated playlist.

In summary, every choice made was based on existing approaches.

### Modal Screen
**The modal will show up when the user opens Spotify**. It’s an invitation to walk and avoid using the car. The playlist and podcasts serve as inspiration to take action.

Here's an example:

Then there’s an alternative modal, the lack of imagery gives a more serious tone to the problem.

**I've chosen to use a modal to give the users an immediate and clear CTA**. If there wasn’t a modal, the other approaches would probably be ignored since they don’t require as much attention.

### Dedicated Section
This section is located at the homescreen, visible after the user sees the modal.

It will contain the Spotify generated playlist and some podcasts on the topic of air pollution if the user wants to get informed.

This is very common in the Spotify Design System. I choose this approach since:
- It flows with the content
- **The user can keep scrolling** and ignore it
- **The user has a central place to come back to** in case they want to check it out some other time.

### Advertisement
It will show up only to non-premium users.

**The ad will explain why the user should pay attention to air pollution and what he can do to help**, such as walking or taking public transport instead of using their car. Finally, it will invite to check out the playlist and some podcasts.

**It will show up when the user is listening to content and it’s time for an advertisement but there isn’t one available**. Could also be played when the user is using Spotify inside the car.

I chose this approach since Spotify shows an ad even if they are not available, so **we could take advantage of this and send our message, especially to driving users**.

### Personalized Playlist
This is how the playlist will look when the user opens it. It would be based on the user’s tastes and generated automatically by Spotify.

Also, **the playlist could be regenerated every day** to allow the user to listen every day when they are walking and not get bored of the same repeating songs.

**I chose this approach to inspire the users. It could be irritating to be asked to take a walk, so the playlist and podcast can encourage a desired and healthier behavior.**

### Conclusion
To communicate the importance of air pollution, the first step was to research on Spotify, to understand how their Design System could handle this task. Looking at many use cases and different components, I decided to use these approaches:

- **Modal screen:** to give an immediate and clear CTA.
- **Dedicated section on homescreen:** serves as a central point to return to.
- **Advertisement:** will show only to non-premium users when an advertisement is not available, to take advantage of the empty space and inform directly those who are driving.
- **Personalized playlist and podcasts:** to encourage users to walk.

All of these decisions were based on existing designs, this will help keep the app consistent and avoid introducing new unnecessary components and possibly changing the UX/UI of the app.
